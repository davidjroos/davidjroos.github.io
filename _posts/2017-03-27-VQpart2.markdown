Victoria Quarter suffers for the Southern Motorway, and this alignment exists to serve the ego of Mayer John Allum:

> This lack of foresight and common sense was compounded by Auckland city fathers led by former Mayor Sir John Allum, chairman of the bridge authority. He lobbied the National Roads Board to reconfigure State Highway 1 from its previous designated route around the city (ironically about where State Highway 20 is being retrofitted now at enormous cost) to a route directly through the centre of suburban and inner-city Auckland (causing great damage) and on to the bridge.
>
As former National Cabinet minister W.J. (Jack) Scott recalled in May 1999, State Highway 1 was moved because Sir John feared the toll revenue would be insufficient.
>
Sir John, he said, "had never been associated with a failure. No way was he going to run the bridge at a loss." It was Jack Scott who pointed out that originally the southern and northwestern motorways were meant to be linked as ring road around the city - not slicing through it.

Of course, anywhere the motorway went through would have the same fate -
perhaps it is unfair to throw Westmere and Ponsonby under that
particular bus.

Indeed.

So we got this:

Beyond the removal of the northbound offramp into Franklin Road and the
realignment of Union Street to make space for a carpark at the end of
Sale Street, this is pretty much what we have today.

Ultimately, nothing can be done about the existence of motorway any time
soon - everything is hung up in the AWHC:

-   Previous plans to bury the entire Victoria Viaduct was prevented
-   Route protection for a third decade ATAP project will restrict all
    change until I am an old man

The best case is the removal of the viaducts as part of a road AWHC
crossing. In 30 years.

In the meantime, there is a surface level motorway passing through, with
nothing to mitigate the noise or pollution it causes.

## Cook Street

Conversely, I feel that Cook Street is something that can be changed
today.

Why does anything need to be done? Because it is a canyon of disconnect,
but it has <i>potential</i>:

It's is the biggest obstacle to integrating Victoria Quarter with
neighbouring communities, Freemans Bay (including Freemans Bay School
and Auckland Girls Grammar), K’Rd, Eastern Ponsonby and Grey Lynn. The
existence of this street in its current form fundamentally prevents
movements between these areas. If you’ve ever tried to cross this
street, you’d encounter something like this, on a route between Victoria
Quarter and the nearest school

Here it is at the other end, narrowed down one lane each way, yet
somehow still functioning:

[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3951/32843694994_6d363679eb_c.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3951/32843694994_708520a986_o.jpg)

It is, of course, possible to cross at any point. But due to the blind
rise, the number of lanes (three, for a single lane offramp), the high
speed of vehicles exiting the motorway, a lack of signalling and sudden
lane changes, this is never safe and I'd wager impossible for children,
the disabled, the elderly or anyone not willing to run across. There is
an allocated crossing at the point with least visibility near Sam
Wrigley Street, pictured below. Cars may park in the marked spaces at
the bottom right of this image, directly in front of the crossing,
further reducing visibility.

The kerbs here are, pointlessly, inaccessible to wheelchairs and an
obstacle to prams, especially with cars bearing down well above the
marked speed limit.

Once you've crossed onto the traffic island, further difficulties arise
crossing North to Placemakers or the South to residential units. Going
North, cars are turning at high speeds around the sweeping right turn,
usually without indicating from a ‘straight+turn' lane, over a blind
rise. This traffic is then mixed in with traffic exiting from (and
around) Placemakers that will be checking for speeding cars to their
left, not pedestrians attempting to cross on their right.

(Oh whoops, make that four lanes)

Sam Wrigley is made up of two sweeping turns merging into one. It is
clear in the image below that the width of both roads is very wide and
intended to allow cars to negotiate the corners at high speeds, with no
consideration for pedestrian needs.

### Stop getting in the way of cars, jerk!

To cross Cook Street at a safe, controlled intersection requires a
detour of around 700m - 350m each way to Nelson Street and back, around
10 minutes. Or you could opt to head up Nelson Street, if that works for
you, within this rather bleak streetscape. Many opt instead to use the
separated Nelson Street bike lane.

The only proposed changes to Cook Street are related to the SH1
Additional Waitematā Harbour Crossing project, which ATAP has now
aligned with the third decade, meaning 20-30 years of the status quo
(Unless a future government rams it through regardless).

One of the proposed solution results in a tunnel portal which will be a
blight on the area, along with the proposed roads not taking into
account existing local building access on Cook Street. Nothing in this
design considers the wider goals for the area, primarily focusing on
ease of access to motor vehicles into the central city two decades from
now, though it would at least permit safe crossing of Cook Street if the
proposed link road between Sale and Union Streets has the radius
tightened.

The previously proposed realignment of the off-ramp up Union Street
would have solved this issue (and by solved I mean made it someone
else's problem, though Grade separation of Union Street is much simpler
than on Cook Street), but Auckland Council sold the Union Street car
park to NZTA to use as the Central Incident Response Centre and it's not
clear who is really in charge of what happens in this area.

## Who's fault is this?

The current arrangement is here simply because no one ever changed
anything. Cook Street has been this wide since its inception, with the
same blind rise. There is no modelling that decided it needed to be this
many lanes of traffic - when Cook street was turned into an offramp in
the 60s, all that width was used solely because it existed - if one lane
was enough, but there was space for more, then why not have as many as
possible?

## What to do?

In lieu of anything changing and the AWHC being decades away (assuming
it brings with it any positive change), we need a solution to address
the severance caused by Cook Street and the Motorway.

To address the motorway severance would require:

1.  Reconnecting Sale/Cook or Union to Freemans Bay School via bridge or
    massively improving pedestrian priority and amenity on the routes to
    and from the school and other areas
2.  Noise Barriers
3.  Placemaking on the periphery of the motorway to deal with the to the
    'industrial wasteland' vibe

I can see three options for Cook Street, all of which I believe are
required:

1.  Introduce speed reduction tools to slow Cook Street traffic
2.  Produce a safe, midblock crossing that aligns to pedestrian desire
    lines
3.  Grade separate the Cook Street off-ramp traffic from local traffic
    (with a potential realignment around placemakers site up Union, or
    just restricting to one, narrow, lane)

Most of this is _already identified and discussed_ in the CCMP and
District Plan. But where are the actual, tangible, timelined plans to do
anything? How are brownfield sites ever going to compete with new
suburbs if Auckland Council and Auckland Transport treat the non-vehicle
users of these areas with such disdain?

Next time I'll be covering vehicle priority and pedestrian design
failures in area.
