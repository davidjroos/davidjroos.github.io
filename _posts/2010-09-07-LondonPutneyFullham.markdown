### Tuesday 7 September 2010

Arrived in London ever so slightly short on sleep at 7:30am, decided to
stick it out as long as possible. I stayed up by exploring Putney (where
I am staying) a bit - lots of little side streets with rows of
(attractive) house upon house. It all has the quaint factor, but still a
bit too snug for my liking. Worth the trade off for decent public
transport though, perhaps.

Crossed the Thames to a park near Putney bridge with an old church and
some flower gardens, nothing spectacular but it was nice a cool walk
along the Thames and the air seemed fresh. There was a little cafe
alongside the church that the pidgeons seemed to like. Another suburb
opposite Putney was fairly similar, but a bit more upper class (the
houses looked the same, but there were flasher cars). On one street
almost every single house was being worked on, gutted etc - an up and
coming suburb it seems.

Alongside the nice houses were a few giant buildings with quite
classical and attractive architecture with their own private gardens,
not sure what they were, but plonked right in the middle of it all,
where I imagine at some point was a park/square, was a block of awful
old council flats which was horribly out of place but typically English.
Then home for a nap.
