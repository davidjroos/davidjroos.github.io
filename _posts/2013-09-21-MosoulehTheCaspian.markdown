Headed west out of Tehran before heading North, via a big mountain pass
where we dropped from about 1600m to \~250 through some pretty dramatic
terrain and a ton of Wind farms at Manjil.

Stopped somewhere around Roodbar, I think, for lunch. A bit after that
you turn a corner and suddenly everything turns green, which is a bit of
a shock after nothing but rocks and sand for almost 2 weeks. Got onto
the road to Masouleh (via Fouman) and it was very NZ like - steep valley
with lots of green and rivers etc). Except for the garbage! There must
only be a handful of places like this in Iran and they just leave their
mess everywhere.

At Masouleh it was parking chaos - it was very busy and people are a bit
dim when it comes to parking everywhere (ignoring the massive, empty
carpark that is an extra 5 minutes walk, instead opting to fight for 15
minutes for a carpark that little bit closer....).

The village was pretty, but it was so busy that it was a bit hard to
appreciate. The further up we climbed the quieter it got though and I
ended up enjoying it. The clouds and haze made photos a pain, but still
nice.

We picked the right time though, as it was only just starting to get
busy - the chaos we were in coming in had vastly worsened ... Drank some
tea for a bit instead and took a slow drive down the hill. The garbage
everywhere was really upsetting me and makes me appreciate NZ that much
more.

Passing through Rasht was annoying - the traffic was terrible and all
the buildings had corrugated steel on their sides... to keep the water
out... It was explained very matter-of-factly. Perhaps there are issues
with water tightness in the concrete used (on account of it not raining
much elsewhere), but I thought it was pretty stupid, and very, very
ugly.

Saw my first glimpse of the Caspian through a navy base before stopping
at a public beach (most are privately owned by hotels etc) and there was
just garbage everywhere and the whole place was just really depressing.
I had no expectations, but it was still disappointing. Everyone there
seemed happy enough though - hanging out, swimming or playing volleyball
with the lifeguards. A family came to talk to me for a bit, though their
english was not great.

The whole 'resort' area was pretty tired. I asked Majid if this is what
the other resort towns (without being specific) and he said that indeed
it was. Found the hotel eventually and settled in for the night.

### 2013-09-21

Got up early (not on purpose though) and went for a walk on the hotel's
beach. It was a bit tidier but I suspect you can't stop it all from
washing up. It was really eerie - gloomy still, full moon still visible,
fog, abandoned looking playground with a squeaky gate I had to go though
and very, very quiet. A pack of stray dogs at the other end of the
beach. I took of my shoes and put my feet in the water because I'd
probably regret it if I didn't.
