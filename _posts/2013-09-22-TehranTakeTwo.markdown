After some confusion about what time I was actually meeting Majid (with
daylight saving kicking in a day earlier than anticipated), we got under
way. Caught the train (as driving was a mission) to the National Museum
where I saw a lot of cool things, most notably all the good stuff from
Persepolis along with some really, really, really old things (as in,
250,000 years old).

Caught the train again out to Azadi/Freedom tower/monument to take
photos properly this time (instead of by car driving around in circles).
But by golly it was hot. And by that I mean it was really, really
fucking hot.

From there we headed up to Tajrish/Darband to wander a different part of
the foothills of the mountain. This part was full of cafes and
restaurants and was beautifully temperate.

Headed back to hotel to pick up bags and grabbed some dinner on the way
to the airport, where I was dropped at about 11pm, with 5 or so hours to
kill until my flight.

Arrived in Auckland and went to sleep at some point, 52 hours after I
woke up on Sunday in Tehran. The End.
