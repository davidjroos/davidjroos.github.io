### October 4, 2010 – What next?

Today the PPVs – Project Planning Visits begin – those in Nicaragua head
off after lunch today and Costa Rican based PMs leave tomorrow morning.
I was scheduled for the new and unnamed Costa Rican trek PPV starting
tomorrow morning. I am, right at the start of Phase 1 (16 October),
going to be doing that exact part of the trek with the PMs and
venturers, so I am pulling out of the PPV to give my (very sore) knees
and back a chance to recover. I am hoping to go along on a different PPV
if possible, otherwise I will take it easy here and do whatever needs
doing and perhaps some radio training.

So... my schedule will be as follows:

-   Today through until Thursday I will be at field base (Will update if
    I am off on a PPV)
-   After that I am a bit fuzzy until the 16th. I will be around a bit,
    but the venturers arrive on the 10th and there are more jungle camps
    and other bits that need doing.
-   October 16th I am out on trek and I am back on the 20th until the
    24th
-   On the 25th I’m road tripping around Costa Rica and I’m back on the
    2nd of November at some point for probably 6-8 days until Phase
    2 starts.

After that I have no idea!

### Interlude – October 10, 2010 – Scottish Night

Last night was the last chance for a few drinks before the Venturers
arrive – it’s dry here when the kiddies are around. So Scottish night it
was, with Mohjitos, dressing up and Scottish dancing.

### October 14, 2010

Venturers arrived a couple of days ago – I drove to San Jose to pick
some up and dropped off my laptop at the same time. Still waiting to
hear what the issue is there. Will chase them up tomorrow as they were
supposed to get hold of me on Tuesday…..

This morning the zoom mechanism on my main lens has gotten itself
busted. I suspect some grit got into there. The whole thing kind of
jammed up and the flash wasnt working properly with it. I’ve spent a lot
of today pricing up replacements and researching etc, walking to
Turrialba to try the two (utterly useless) camera shops and trying to
find stores in San Jose. Fortunately Julian, the big country manager
person knows a photography instructor and gave her a call and got a
number for a store that sells lenses and could possibly fix my current
one.

The prices of photgraphic equipment here is, I understand, quite
unreasonable, so I initially placed an order with B&H in the states, but
they are not happy that my Visa billing address is in a country
different to my shipping address, so require the money wired. BNZ seemed
to require me to go into a branch or spend half an hour on the phone to
them at international rates for that to happen. Add to that the
potential for a huge duty tax should I actually manage to get anything
delivered and it’s all a bit hard.

I gave it a good twist just before, doing all sorts of terrible things
to the remaining mecahnics, but now at least I can manually pull and
push the front of the lens to get the zoom working. Will still replace
it if the price is reasonable, but wll do for now. I just dont trust it
to last!

On more ‘why I’m actually here’ news: I’m off on Saturday morning for
3-4 days of trekking up Volcan Turrialba before being back at Field base
for a few days. Then I’m off for about 10 days making my way around
Costa Rica visiting the various project sites. I very strongly doubt I
will be around then – but if I have my laptop I can probably get some
wifi somewhere so who knows!

But yes, the Venturers are here – it has been super busy but tonight
they are at jungle camp and it is beautifully quiet here

Pizza time (even though I already had dinner and a chocolate....

### October 16, 2010 – Phase 1 begins

Tomorrow I am off climbing Volcan Turrialba for 4 long days. The first
three days are the ascent – around 2500m, followed by an 18km downhill
day before I meet up with the first food drop and am whisked away to
Fieldbase for 1000 hours of sleep. I’m packing as light as possible and
will be getting some help with adjusting my bag to keep the weight in
the right place – on my hips (which is quite hard when you don’t have
any) and off my shoulders.

Volcan Turrialba is the smoking volcano visible in one of my earlier
pictures(between the rows of sugar cane). We climb right up to the
summit through primeval jungle with lots of wildlife about. I meet up
again with this trek a couple of weeks later to do another summit – the
Dragon, this time sans backpack as it is a day trip up and down (we can
drive fairly close to it).

So tomorrow morning I’m off very first thing, to return late on Tuesday
the 19th and will be around fieldbase for a couple of days before
heading off on a roadtrip of Costa Rica to visit the other three
projects. Not sure on dates at the moment but will update when I know.

Computer wise – the motherboard has failed and a new one is on its way
from wherever – 9-10 days as of tuesday I think, then a day to fix, puts
it at around the 26th of October if all goes well. Hopefully if we are
on the road then we can swing by San Jose to pick it up!

Lens wise… it’s very hard to sort. No one sells anything Nikon in Costa
Rica, and if I’m not careful I will be hit with a massive import duty
when I buy something. Add to that the difficulties of actually paying –
no one will take a visa issued in NZ with a delivery address in Costa
Rica which means that I need to try use a bank/Western Union here to
wire money directly from my Visa to their account or call BNZ
internationally as they don’t have any facility to do it online (at
least as far as I can see). One of the semi-permanents here is heading
back to London for a couple of weeks which could be useful though… But
then my current lens actually still works – it just doesnt zoom by
twiting it – I need to manually pull it out and push it in again.

Where I will be until the 5th of November: 16 October – 19 October On
Trek up Volcan Turrialba with Alpha 2 20 October – 24 October Fieldbase
25 October La Cangreja National Park with Alpha 3 26 October – 27
October Camaronal (Turtle conservation project) with Alpha 4 28 October
Dragon Base with Alpha 2 again 29 October Climb Dragon with Alpha 2 30
October – 31 October San Lucas Island with Alpha 5 1 November Playa Palo
Seco with Alpha 2 2 November – 5 November Back at Field Base

### October 22, 2010 – Trekking

So I’m back from four days of trekking with not quite the outcome that I
expected.

They were four hard days – every one of them. The first day was
dissapointing for being unable to cross the river so early on, the
second for the difficulties in finding a new route and the amount of
boring road walking we did, the third for the foot pain and the fourth
for the massive amounts of hills we climbed and the huge double back we
had to make.

But the hardest thing for me was the guilt I felt for leaving with the
food drop. We’d been through so much and there was still a couple of
really hard hours to go (huge hill and added weight of the new food) and
it really felt like I was taking the easy way out and abandoning them.

I can’t believe how much I enjoyed it – I really can understand why
people do it and I can only imagine the feeling of satisfaction and
achievement they will feel walking down onto the beach on the Pacific
coast after 19 days. They are a great bunch – though my usual cynical
eyes didn’t think so immediately. After just a couple of days they had
all showed their metal and I couldn’t believe what they were putting up
with without so much as a murmour.

When I showered that night it felt like I was washing it all away (holy
hell did I stink), but also more than that, everything felt different
and lighter. Walking and talking and thinking gives you a lot of time to
think and I have a few more ideas about my life that I want to explore
when I get home. When I finish Raleigh I want it to be the start of the
best part of my life, not the end.

The next morning was really beautiful and it dawned on me that I’m only
1 month in and already have had the most amazing time of my life. I

Can’t wait for whatever comes next!
