Grabbed a couple of [Bycyklen](http://bycyklen.dk/en/), regardless of
the cold. I was excited. Bike specs:

-   Gates Carbon Belt Drive
-   GPS enabled tablet for navigation and payment
-   Pedal Assist Electric Front Motor
-   Front and rear racks
-   Powered lights, front and rear
-   Hydraulic seat adjustment
-   Weight: 450kg (approx.)

and I hated them. Checking them in and out worked well, and I guess the
lights and belt drive were ok. But they were heavy and the electric
assist was disastrous, possibly because all the gears were broken (or
non-existent, I could not tell). It was either actively assist while
spinning your legs at 100 rpm or pedal slowly enough to trick the motor
to engage without you actually engaging any power yourself. This
happened on multiple bikes and made it a very frustrating ride. Changing
bikes because of such faults were costly too, because you are charged
for a full hour (\~ €3.5) if you need to swap for a more functional one.

Emily thinks they are fine, so maybe I was just unlucky or my
expectations were unreasonable (note: my expectations were a bike that I
could pedal to make it go)

But it was still better than walking and we got to Den Lille Havfrue
(The Little Mermaid) statue only partly frozen to death.

Then it was another frustrating ride back south to Amalienborg where we
(I?) got shouted at by the man with the fuzzy hat for either:

-   Walking more than 3cm away from my bike
-   Attempting to take a third photo of the square

(fuzzy hat man seen at bottom right)

Anyway, Frederik's Church is lovely

Back to (the now sunny) Nyhavn

And along the Havnepromenade

Ugh

Why?

Then back up through the city to Kongens Have (Rosenborg Castle Gardens)

Looking North up Store Kongensgade

The other side of Frederik's Church

[![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1556/24382918451_42f20c995d_c.jpg)](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1556/24382918451_6745b43c8e_o.jpg)

Then we were done! Back to the hotel to grab our bits, on the metro to
the airport. It's a pretty decent airport but I'm totally over all of
them. At least Schiphol feels familiar now!
