After arriving back from a stint in Vancouver and Amsterdam, my partner
and I decided we wanted some outdoor space and another bedroom. While
our mobility needs are 100% met by walking, cycling and transit, a car
park was also on the check-list to ensure that we made the most of
Auckland and New Zealand.

We couldn't find anything that met our rather simple goals in the city
and couldn't stomach moving any further out (Mount Eden is the wops to
me), so we started looking at new builds and narrowed it down to a
handful of developments - one on Beach Road, one in Eden Terrace and one
down the end of Sale Street, in what Auckland Council calls Victoria
Quarter. I find Beach Road generally unpleasant, Eden Terrace lost out
due to poor amenity and being at the top of a hill, kneecapped by the
loss of its CRL station. Ultimately, we decided on the Victoria Quarter
Development. There were a lot of reasons, but the Council's goals for
the area played a part in the decision.

Since signing the paperwork mid last year, I've spent a lot of time in
the area, mostly to watch the demolition and hole digging that have
occurred on site so far. Unfortunately, like anything I look at for long
enough, the problems started to mount. The area is not 'fit for
purpose'. So I threw together a document over a few nights and submitted
it to the chair of the Waitematā Local Board and the Waitematā and Gulf
Ward Councillor.

That submission sought out to essentially say one thing: why is nothing
happening to achieve the Council's stated goals for the area?

This will be the first in a series of posts based on that submission,
with some expansions. All photos are my own, unless referenced.

# Victoria Quarter?

The oldest reference to Victoria Quarter that I can find is in the
Auckland Council District Plan from 2005. It's conceptual existence may
go back much further, but I cannot find any reference to it on the
Council search engines, nor Google.

It's defined by the [Auckland District
Plan](http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/central/pdfs/part1410.pdf)
as the area bounded by thick black lines below:

The 'Nelson and Hobson street upgrade' at least exists as a line item in
various [Auckland City Centre Advisory Board meeting
minutes](http://infocouncil.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/Open/2016/12/CEN_20161207_AGN_7002_AT_WEB.htm)
and on the [Projects in the city
centre](http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/planspoliciesprojects/CouncilProjects/citycentretransformation/Pages/investmentinthecitycentre.aspx)
page while the Victoria Street Linear Park has been well discussed in
the past. I'm mostly interested in the western corner, between Victoria
Park, Wellesley Street and Cook Street, which has no known plans in
place.

# Victoria Quarter

## A bit of history

I am not qualified to describe the history of Auckland in any detail,
but some interesting facts include that it's one of the earliest places
to be settled in Auckland, Drake Street used to be a small cliff
overlooking Freemans Bay before reclamation was completed around 1901
(creating Victoria Park) and the Destructor (now Victoria Park Market),
completed in 1905, converted garbage into electricity. Fascinating.

![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3838/32864209013_dfc77382f4_c.jpg)

*22 June 1905 - Mr A. M. Myers, Mayor of Auckland laying the last brick

Mayor, Mr. A. M. Myers, performing the opening ceremony (Sir George Grey
Special Collections, Auckland Libraries, AWNS-19051228-15-4)*

But fear not - I will not be attempting to use nostalgia to convince you
that this area has value because it is old - I've not seen any evidence
that it was ever much more than a slum adjacent to various industrial
areas and the city morgue. It even had the plague. There is a reason
they built the motorway through it in the 60's and as a result Victoria
Quarter and the Harbour Bridge are inexorably intertwined, but we'll
talk about that later.

Libraries, 1370-29-32-3)*

Not a lot has fundamentally changed since the Harbour Bridge was built -
just a gradual move from industrial to light industrial and finally to
office space, hospitality and residential.

## Here and now

### Commercial

While a large number of buildings in the area of are primarily low rise
and semi-industrial, many are office space. A list of newly complete,
refurbished and or currently under construction includes:

-   Dentsu Aegis (68 Sale Street)
-   Masons Commercial 2 (46 Sale Street)
-   32 Sale Street

Including some residential developments below, six of the nine sites on
the Southern side of Sale Street were either recently rebuilt/renovated
or are currently under construction.

*Developments on Sale Street*

### Hospitality

The much lauded Clooney secludes itself from the street, while revellers
at The White Rabbit, La Zeppa, TomTom and The Oakroom contend with
narrow footpaths of Drake Street. A handful of other cafés are present,
though few have any possibility to interface with the street. Turko
makes best use of its narrow footpath to provide some street activation.

[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2922/33677571735_120424d880_c.jpg)](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2922/33677571735_81a3465716_o.jpg)

*Turko, Corner of Drake and Centre Streets*

Victoria Park market is isolated from Victoria Park, College Hill and
the surrounding Victoria Quarter. It is not expected that Victoria
Street will be reduced in width for the foreseeable future. This,
coupled with poor connections through to Sale Street, and anywhere else,
results in the market being somewhat dead.

Finally, a Swiss-Belsuites hotel has emerged atop the multistory carpark
at the intersection of Drake, Victoria Wellesley and Vernon Streets.

### Residential

Excluding the existing residences within Victoria Quarter, on Nelson and
Hobson Streets and surrounds, properties currently under development in
the immediate vicinity comprise of more than 350 units, housing upwards
of 600 people.

-   Grace VQ (100+ units)
-   Sale Street Residences (14 units)
-   Union Green (150 units)
-   Union & Co (100+ units)
-   132 Halsey (38 units, still in presales)

The highest concentration existing residential is on Vernon Street, but
there are units dotted throughout the area.

*Vernon Street residential units alongside a new office block*

### Transit

Wellesley Street is currently and planned to be a major bus route into,
across and out of the city, with the [City Centre Future Access Study
(CCFAS)](http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/representativesbodies/MayorofAuckland/Documents/CCFAS1.pdf)
stating a requirement for approximately 150 buses per hour along
Wellesley Street in the 2021 Reference Case.

Existing and imminent routes include every alternate Northern Express,
western buses and the Outer Link.

![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2885/32864208063_83826e8816_o.jpg)

*Bus Counts on Wellesley Street in the 2021 Reference Case (CCFAS)*

The now finalised and imminent Central Suburbs New Network implements a
base of 52 buses per hour at peak. This is calculated by taking 60
minutes and dividing it by proposed service frequencies.

*Approved bus routes along Wellesley Street as part of [Central Suburbs New Network](https://at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/new-public-transport-network/new-network-for-the-central-suburbs/)*

Potential BRT/tunnelling (detailed in CCFAS and the [AT Airport and Mangere rail design](https://at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/airport-and-mangere-rail/)) is completely unplanned and unbudgeted for and is assumed to not be occurring.

![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3727/33677573055_d77fda2cb2_c.jpg)

*Proposed alignment for BRT tunnel in AT Airport and Mangere rail desing design*

Sale Street is around 600m away from the future Aotea Square CRL
station, less than a 10 minute walk, so it's clear that Victoria Quarter
is an area that is very well served by transit, and that is only set to
improve.

### Transient Use

Pedestrians and cyclists pass through Victoria Quarter to access
Victoria Park, the grocery store at the foot of Franklin road, College
Hill, Wynyard Quarter and the now-approved Sky Path.

Vehicles passing through the roads making up western Victoria Quarter
are doing so to bypass Victoria, Wellesley and Hobson Streets or access
large, surface level parking facilities at the City Works Depot.

Close proximity to the future NZICC will likely encourage both
pedestrians and cars through the area.

### Parking

This area is supported by a large amount of publicly accessible parking
facilities:

-   Tournament Parking (City Works Depot)
-   Swiss-Belsuites (which has emerged with more parking than it
    started with)
-   Sky City
-   Victory Christian Church
-   AT Sale Street (121 Sale Street)
-   Union Street angle parking, between Placemakers and Wellington
    Street
-   Union Street angle parking, near Drake Street

This list does not include the 750-900 parking spaces to be provided by
the NZICC upon completion.

# Goals

That all is what is, but what of the future? When I mentioned the
Council's 'goals' previously, I was referring to set a of specific
statements in various plans:

## Auckland Council District Plan Operative Auckland City - Central Area Section 2005, Section 14.10
[Document Link](http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/central/pdfs/part1410.pdf)

This document has a range of objectives, policies and strategies laid
out around:

-   Built Form
-   Heritage
-   Public Open Space
-   Social And Economic
-   Pedestrian Access, Street Quality And Gateways
-   Public Safety
-   Ecological Sustainability
-   Transport

Overall it's a great document, they close it off with the following (my
emphasis):

> It is expected that the provisions adopted for the Quarter will result
> in the following.
>
> -   An environment that encourages activities which enhance the
>     vitality, vibrancy and interest of the Quarter while ensuring that
>     their adverse effects are avoided or mitigated.
> -   A high quality environment exhibiting **good urban design,
>     residential amenity and quality open spaces**.
> -   The retention and enhancement of existing scheduled heritage
>     buildings, heritage features and character areas through the
>     appropriate design of adjacent built form.
> -   A diverse and vibrant environment which complements the Central
>     Area and which provides a good standard of amenity for
>     building occupants.
> -   **Comfortable, safe and attractive pedestrian accessibility
>     throughout**.
> -   Quality buildings that promote sustainable design, the distinctive
>     identity and desirability of the Quarter as a location within
>     the City.
> -   Adaptable built form which encourages the reuse of building space
>     and activities at ground level.
> -   **The maintenance and enhancement of the existing character of the
>     area including public open spaces**.
> -   Retention of the historic character of the Former City
>     Destructor/Victoria Park Markets Site while enabling the
>     redevelopment of the existing car park building in a complementary
>     sustainable manner.
> -   The **comprehensive and integrated development of the Former City
>     Depot Site** which provides a high level of internal and external
>     amenity, quality public open space and which sits comfortably
>     within the Quarter.

> residential and commercial occupants
>
> **Establish a broad range of parks, squares and plazas** Provide an
> open space network that enables a linkage from Victoria Park through

> amenity and streetscape of Hobson, Nelson, Fanshawe Street and the
> motorway is also necessary to enhance this
>
> **Reconnect Victoria Quarter with inner city suburbs and the rest of
> the CBD** Redevelopment will require additional linkages over the
> arterial roads and motorway in order to connect future occupants with
> the CBD and inner city suburbs
>
> **Recognise and celebrate significant heritage features** Note the
> former shore line, Iwi and heritage buildings/sites (Maori heritage
> sites, Victoria Park Markets, Freeman's Hotel, Berlei factory, Empire
> Tavern).
>
> **Reduce dominance of the existing road network so as not to
> compromise the liveability of the quarter**
>
> **Improve pedestrian amenity of primary access routes to the CBD
> whilst enabling access efficiency and providing public transport** To
> improve the appearance and walkability of access routes as people
> places whilst retaining transport (private/public) importance
>
> **Quality design for private development and in the public realm**
> Advocate quality design for private development and lead by example in
> the public realm
>

### Existing Flavour (Experience of place)
>
> Dominance of traffic - disjunctive development - diverse development -
> barren and bleak in parts - through passage - hard and urban - tourism
> destination - non descript - mix of older character areas with
> industrial development - intimate parts - active in parts
>

### Future Direction
>
> Transition from fringe to core - place of social and commercial
> interaction/exchange - internal urban activity - internal focus centre
> of gravity - pleasant environment - low key - cruisy - city family
> location - promote activity generators - interlinking network of urban
> neighbourhoods - liveable & creative
>

### Existing Character (Physical)
>
> Large areas of poor quality design - housing diversity - large blocks
> - lack of connections - basin topography - former shoreline heritage -
> Victoria Park - Victoria Park Markets - warehouse type buildings -
> creative industries
>

### Future Direction
>
> Creative industries - good urban design - diverse housing stock -
> redevelopment of larger sites to act as catalyst for quarter linkages
> - celebrated heritage experiences - good pedestrian amenity of primary
> access routes - good open space network reduced transport dominance

# Brownfield, Greenfield, Density, The Environment (and everything else)

Victoria Quarter should be an excellent example of a walkable, mixed
use, medium density, brownfield development for all to see. The epitome
of 'up not out'. This and the aforementioned Council goals matter
because Auckland and New Zealand need to be convinced that this sort of
housing is not only acceptable, but preferable. The economic and
environmental costs of suburban sprawl will never be addressed
otherwise, and, like encouraging transit use, you need to present a
workable alternative if you want change.

We see that the Council already understands that these sorts of
brownfield developments help to meet transport goals and deal with
congestion (<i>Auckland Plan, Chapter 8</i>)

> high-density and mixed land-use patterns which reduce the demand for
> travel and shorten trips

and reduce environmental impact (<i>Auckland Plan, Chapter 13</i>)

> The challenge for Auckland is to separate the link between GHG
> emissions and development, economic growth, and energy use. This will
> require a transformation from a fossil fuel-dependent, high
> energy-using, high-waste society to an ‘eco- or liveable city’. A
> liveable city is typified by sustainable resource use, <i>a quality
> compact form</i>, an eco-economy, and transport and energy systems that
> are efficient, maximise renewable resources and minimise reliance on
> fossil-based transport fuels.

But we need some convincing... (<i>Auckland Plan, Chapter 11</i>)

> At present there is a limited but growing market for intensified
> housing. The reasons for this include the traditional New Zealand
> preference for detached homes, expectations of the size of housing
> that far exceed incomes, and examples of poorly designed apartments,
> especially in the CBD.

What especially doesn't help is that we have brownfield developments
such as Victoria Quarter, that are stuck with poor urban amenity, and
greenfield sites with perfectly smooth, compliant, accessible footpaths,
correct gradients and lovely landscaping. I don't care how this is
ultimately paid for, only about <i>equality of outcomes</i> - there is
nothing stopping the council putting a levy on developments for
improvements for brownfield sites. Nor do I intend to to pour scorn on
areas like Stonefields, Long Bay or Hobsonville Point - my intent is to
highlight that it is difficult to convince anyone that a walkable,
transit oriented, medium density, mixed use community is for them, their
children and their retirement when the footpaths and streetscape looks
like this:

[![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3934/33548022801_0bd08b3fee_c.jpg)](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3934/33548022801_3536b00880_o.jpg)

*Hobsonville Point [© oh.yes.melbourne \[Sydney Struwig\]](https://ohyesmelbourne.com/)*

Who cares if you can reduce your dependence on your car if it's too
awkward and dangerous for you or your children to walk anywhere?

# Now what?

The area is currently rife with unnecessarily wide, unsafe streets and
dangerous intersections, with car parking squeezed in everywhere
possible at the cost of pedestrian amenity. Uneven, inappropriate and
inaccessible footpaths are reduced to almost nothing to allow for
further car parking and are almost always blocked by street furniture,
garbage/recycling bins and parked cars. We have clearly define goals for
the area, but unlike for the new-build suburbs, no ‘pre-work’ is being
done to prepare the area or address the many failings for current or
future residents. This is despite the fact that the area is already well
connected by transit and well populated with office workers, residents
and hospitality guests. The area is undergoing strong development and
growth, with at least 500 new residents and hundreds of office workers
expected within the next 2 years.

I will set out to describe the major obstacles to the vision for
Victoria Quarter in the hope of progressing the discussion around the
amenity provided to residents of greenfield vs. brownfield developments
and that of getting the Council to begin creating (and publishing) real
commitments to their 'vision' documents. NZTA, Auckland Transport and
Auckland Council already have the to tools to fix these issues, so I
will avoid being overly prescriptive.

I am not interested in a gold-plated, Wynyard Quarter style, ground-up
redevelopment - just a plan to address the major shortcomings.
