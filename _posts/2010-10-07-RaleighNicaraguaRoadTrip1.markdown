So my laptop is stuffed.

I’ve found a Lenovo certified place in San Jose (thanks to the very kind
Roberto, who is Costa Rican). I had the option of going up to San Jose
today by bus or waiting until Monday when I would get a ride up with the
people picking up the venturers. Talking to the shop it could take two
weeks to get sorted, but I can make do until then. Better than not
having anything I guess! All under warranty too..

This trip is teaching me to be patient!.

So anyway, my trip (Update! I’ve managed to get Lightroom running (very
slowly) on one of the PCs here so it’s slow going and hard work bu I’ve
now updated the phots to semi deent levels.).

Quite a long update sorry!.

I was swanning about on Sunday expecting to have 5 or 6 days of leisure,
before the driver assigned to the Nicaraguan drive fell ill. I had about
an hour to pack and get ready and then we were off! The group I was
driving was heading up to the North of Nicaragua to do some
reconnaissance for the Maribios Trek (Alpha 1, if you have a look at the
http://raleighcostarica.blogspot.com post detailing the alpha groups).

So we headed out at about three PM. The important factor here is that we
do not drive in the dark (the roads and drivers here are pretty
terrible). It gets dark at about 5:30 generally, light from about 5 –
that means about 12 and a half hours a day for moving about, getting
things done and finding something to sleep. So anyway, our first stop
was just north of San Jose, but we only got as far as the airport. We
found a nice little hotel with a good room and three little poodles for
the night. Cold water though! Dinner that night was recommended by our
host – a ‘great Italian place’ a couple of blocks down. The setting was
lovely – a nice little restaurant 1 story up looking out over the not
lovely area (which really worked for me somehow). Everyone else
foolishly ordered Pizza (I’ve probably not mentioned yet that Central
American cheese is …… really terrible). The pizza were rated somewhere
between awful and ‘I prefer that one’ – That was about the nicest anyone
got. 2/5. I thought I was being clever ordering the ‘Frank Sinatra’
burger, which was fine, but not exactly great. The fries were really
nice though. And the setting was lovely – a bit surreal sitting in a
rather nice restaurant overlooking some pretty manky places with it
pouring with rain outside and eating awful Italian food – it was
actually pretty nice.

Next morning was a 4am wake up (as would be the case every day) to be on
the road by first light (5am). We were headed north for the border and
as far north as we could get on the Inter Americana. We got as far as
San Ramone in Costa Rica before we hit traffic – a dead stop because of
the road being closed due to a land slide.

About an hour later we were on our way through the mountains and we
stopped for a loo break and breakfast(beans, rice, eggs and coffee, a
recurring theme) at Soda El Cruce which was … fine.

We eventually hit the border, about 2 hours behind schedule (also a
recurring theme – you learn to expect it. Did I mention my patience
being slowly improved?).

A quick note on the Inter Americana – it is full of massive trucks and
very very very few passing lanes. This means that you will often be
driving along and see your lane being blocked by trucks hurtling your
way at \~100kph. The best policy is generally to slow down, as they
don’t usually care too much about having enough space to pass safely.
You also need to pass a lot of trucks yourself – 20kph is just not going
to allow you to get anywhere within the times you need to. The good news
is that my gear changes are pretty damned good now!

The border was fine – a ton of paper work and no real structure with
everything happening at the pace at which everyone is accustomed. We had
a checklist of things that needed completing and a fluent Spanish
speaker which both helped greatly. The crossing took about 2 hours and
we were once again on our way – in Nicaragua! After a few kms of flat
grassy land you come alongside the giant lake (you will see it on the
map). IN the middle are two MASSIVE very volcano shaped volcanos. We
pulled up alongside a wind farm with the volcanos in the distance and
ate our tinned beans for lunch. Magic.

We kept of driving north, got off the Inter Americana and cut across,
south of Managua (the capital) before rejoining the Inter Americana
continuing north towards Estele.

Due to delays and the fact that the times provided are fairly optimistic
we never got quiet as far as Estele and had to stop somewhere randomly
as it had gotten quite gloomy. The area we were in was absolutely
beautiful though, and the sunset was just amazing. We found a hotel in a
little town which was very basic, but also very cheap and was quite
frankly good enough. We cooked dinner (macaroni cheese.. kind of) on our
Trangier (special camping stove thing) as there were no food places
nearby and had an early night.

The next morning we headed out a few minutes before sunrise as we had a
lot to do – meet some people, look at some rivers, plan some parts of
the trek, etc, etc. We needed to head from Estele west to El Sauce so
headed across the most direct route. About half an hour in we came to a
halt – big backup of trucks. Walked up to the front and there was a big
section of road that was in a terrible state with a truck stuck,
blocking half the road. The ruts were very deep and there were a lot of
big trucks that were going to cross before we would. Along with that was
absolute chaos – people just do whatever they want here, and several
trucks (BIG trucks) got stuck/made it that much worse,so after some
discussion and a call or two to field base we decided to turn back. The
major issue was that we knew the normal route was out of service –
similar issue.

The only other route was a complete unknown, but it was our only choice!
In the end it was quite lovely. We eventually made it to El Sauce to
meet up with someone who will give all the venturers somewhere to sleep
for the night when the trek passes through.

After that it was off to look at a river crossing – the last time they
tried it was too fast and deep to cross. This meant doubling back 7km –
something that we wish to avoid!

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7634/16809997939_24f661e7f8_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7634/16809997939_d1e84b7bba_o.jpg)

The road to the river was decent, until one point. We got out and had a
look and there seemed to be a good route through, so off we went. We got
about 2m in before I got us well stuck. Long story short, one big rock
at the front, one big rock behind the front right wheel, both left
wheels having no traction as the chassis had bottomed out on the rock
hard clay (which was full of rocks). 2 Hours (and some chunks of
fingernails) later I dug us out (with the kind assistance of some local
men). I was literally head to toe in mud, but it was gratifying because
I managed to get us out at least. We decided that we could not get to
the river crossing, so turned around, the other driver driving.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7631/16376098143_f5e16f8301_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7631/16376098143_6741122cbf_o.jpg)

600m down the road and a stall in some mud meant we were stuck, again,
barely 10 minutes after we got it out of the first one. We dug and dug
some more, but everyone was tired and my fingers could take no more, so
we left it for the night, planning on getting a vehicle the next
morning.
[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7611/16808726590_73049701aa_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7611/16808726590_82e0c92f4e_o.jpg)

We set up the tents, ate some beans, cleaned up our wounds as best we
could and sat lying under the stars (it was very dark out there) and
watching the fireflys flutter about – I couldn’t really have been
happier. At one point a man wandered by, had a poke around the car and
announced that he would be back in an hour to get us out. We didn’t
complain, and after some more star gazing (I saw a shooting star, but no
satellites) he turned up with his younger friend (who I was informed was
quite cute) and they hooked up a hand winch to a tree and spun the shit
out of the tires until we dug ourselves out.

Hallelujah, we could rest easy that night. It was bloody hot though when
I tried to get to sleep and the ground was very hard and bumpy – I
probably slept about 2 hours that night.

The next morning I got a sleep in till 5am as the 3 non drivers decided
that they would walk the 3km to the river crossing while we packed up
the tents and got everything into the car. It was a beautiful morning in
the fog and dappled light, watching the cowboys wander on by on their
way to wherever.

At this point we had 2 days to get back to field base. This meant a
drive as far south as possible, but not after checking out another river
crossing nearby.

No dramas there, and we were soon heading south again, homeward bound.
Our target was a beach resort about an hour north of the border. It was
again a beautiful drive, this time driving past Managua and stopping at
the car wash to get the land rover cleaned up.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7586/16788817437_8f314134c5_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7586/16788817437_8f4af03379_o.jpg)

The service station also sold ice creams and 3L bottles of fresca, which
I can assure you we all enjoyed. It was VERY hot. Behind the service
station was a massive volcanic crater/lake with hundreds of vultures
circling and riding the thermals on – I wish the light was better but it
was quite amazing to say the least. Once we were all cleaned up we
carried on on our way.

We never got to our beach resort, instead opting to stop on the lake
side – a decent hotel near the water.

I spent about an hour in the shower, washing myself, my shoes and other
various things that had gotten muddy. We had dinner at perhaps the
diviest place I’ve ever eaten. As you walk in there are bare lights
hanging with literally thousands of little bugs (miggies) flying around
them. Not just that, but all over the ceilings and in large piles on the
floor below. I can’t say it really bothered me though… I guess after a
few days in Nicaragua my standards had lowered and after only a little
complaining we found a nice dark corner and got some beers and ordered.I
had fried chicken and fries (safe option!). Someone else ordered
something random from the menu and when it arrived the looks on
everyone’s faces and the silence it brought was worth a million dollars
and will be something I remember for the rest of my life. Ask me when
you see me in person and I might be able to explain. We then headed off
to bed – up again at 4.

After packing the car and doing the usual checks I noticed that the
power steering fluid was empty. The day before it was full. I topped it
off and we headed out to the lake shore to watch the sun rise from
behind the volcanos. The whole thing was a bit surreal and quite
amazing. I then realised that what I thought was rain out on the lake
was actually water being whipped up by at least 8 tornados spinning
about, with one particularly well formed funnel. It’s pretty hard to
describe the scene, but I guess you can imagine that it was quite
special.

On the road again, we bolted for the border – we needed to be back in
Turrialba before dark and our schedule had about an hour and a half of
leeway in it, but from previous experience knew to expect delays. We got
to the border just before it opened, so stopped for the usual beans and
coffee (and some Oreos, as it was the medic’s (Cat) birthday) before
getting through in under an hour. While waiting around, the group
noticed some liquid under the car, and I confirmed that we were indeed
leaking power steering fluid. I figured that at one point (when I was
not driving :P ) I though the front left wheel had bottomed out, but now
suspect that the power steering fluid sump got smashed a bit. We managed
to use some rag and a lot of tape to at least slow it down, then bolted
the 70km to the next big town where we were told it would take a day to
fix. We decided that the leaking had slowed enough, bought another
bottle of fluid and would check every hour and top it up. And we were
off – the final stretch. I got us as far as San Jose after after getting
stuck in traffic at San Ramone again (road works this time) for about an
hourand we had lunch and stretched out legs at the restaurant by the
airport. We didn’t really have the time, but I was stuffed and I think
everyone needed a break. We hit San Jose at peak hour, and after getting
a bit lost figured it out and made our way home, winding our way into
filed base with the windows down, the theme song from Top Gun blazing
and with stupid grins on our faces – just as it had gotten dark. Hi
fives all round and straight to dinner.

Quite a trip!
