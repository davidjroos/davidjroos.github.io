### Friday 10 September 2010

More museums today.

Science Museum: horribly disappointing (and poorly laid out). Expecting
too much perhaps, or maybe I'm just getting too old to enjoy this sort
of thing.

Paddington. Boring. Couldnt find Paddington Bear (Sorry Anya). Will
bring a map next time. Had BK though, so that is a plus I guess? Went
home to drop my bag off (Out for dinner tonight).

Then to Victoria and Alfred (or Albert?) Gallery. This was a cool place
with too much to describe, but highlights were the wrought iron, Beatrix
Potter and photography exhibits, along with the awesome and massive
copies of plaster cast columns, doorways etc etc.

Friday night was Brick Lane for a drink at a cool local bar which played
really awesome jazzy...stuff, then a curry after being harassed by
thousands of very enthusiastic Indian men trying to give us a deal. It
was pretty good and we negotiated some free poppadoms. Also quite spicy,
but mine was relatively mild. That will teach me to steal food from
other people's plates.
