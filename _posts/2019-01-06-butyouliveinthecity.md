# You deserve whatever happens to you

As a resident in Auckland's City Centre there are a variety of benefits and compromises. I have an ever changing myriad of job, entertainment,dining and shopping opportunities within walking distance and the widest variety of destinations available to me via transit (and ferry) in the whole of New Zealand. The best bike lanes in the city. Theatres, movie cinemas, food from every region of the world. Food courts to fine dining. 

The downsides are expected in any city - less square meters for your dollar, no garden, the sounds of a bustling city day and night, light pollution, an absence of bird song beyond seagulls squawking, the full spectrum of emergency sirens, drunkenness and buffoons in loud vehicles of all descriptions. But many of these downsides largely contribute to the positive column - an open window to the sounds of the world around you provides a connected feeling and being part of something bigger and having less space means reduced consumption, be it energy or a soda stream machine that you just can't justify the space for. These are good things - empathy and consideration for others, reduced energy usage, less money spent, and a less sad planet. 

The balance tips, for the majority of the time, towards the benefits of the city for the people that choose to make it home.

I accept the downsides as an acceptable trade-off for the benefits - I feel lost in the suburbs, trapped by distance, tied to a car, unable to walk for any other reason than aimless leisure.

But there are limits to one's tolerance for these downsides.

# You must suffer any arbitrary burden I place on you

There are basic needs that all humans need - sleep being a big one. I am a human. My wife is a human. My neighbours - all human.

My goal is to find some empathy from you, the reader who believes me to be deserving of any arbitrary punishment, because already I sense the title of this post forming on your lips. I am pained to write this, because it seems, to me at least, quite odd to ask my neighbours, friends and colleagues to consider that I am as equally deserving of the full spectrum of basic rights that you are. But here we are. I'm sure you have good reasons that make you feel quite justified in treating me this way.

So we start at the beginning: "if that happened outside your house"

You would probably be unhappy if a 10x3m digital (i.e. illuminated) billboard was erected outside your house in [your suburb] and it illuminated your bedroom with its shifting colours and patterns (on its 8 second rotation) throughout the dark hours of e day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year? Lets pretend for a minute that it's compliant with council regulations for brightness (LOL) as if that matters. I'm struggling to imagine any person looking forward to such a thing - the situation clearly providing commercial gain for some company while a landlord gets paid for hosting it and you, your sleep and your sanity, bare the true cost of the sign with nothing to show for it.

You'd have a good whinge about it.

So now not your suburb, someone who lives on the city fringe - outside the motorway ring. How about Eden Terrace?

*Eden Terrace*

<p> </p>

Specifically between Ian McKinnon and Symonds - this area is almost entirely residential and adjacent to leafy Mt Eden. No bars, no nightclubs. But two digital advertising boards (that I am aware of, anyway) that effect far more people than in the one in your neighbourhood might. I'm hoping you are forming some form of distinction here and see the problems these Aucklanders face.

But if I tell you that it happened to me in the City Centre, and that I'm not pleased about it, you would simply state "but you chose to live in the city", as if that nullifies the basic needs of darkness for humans to sleep. By me choosing to live in the city, you believe that I have given up all right to any form of solitude or sleep, and having advertisements burned into my retinas is acceptable to you, and I'm not sure either of us know exactly why.

What exactly does a digital billboard have to do with the city centre? Cities such as Vancouver ban all outdoor advertising, Amsterdam certainly doesn't have any and no one would call it lacking vibrancy or life. Why is it, in your head, a fact of life in the city?

The same applies to any nuisance - noise, pollution, urine and vomit on my doorstep. These things do not define places, they are undesirable and modern society is arranged to minimise them for all members of that society.

So what is the difference between Eden Terrace and the city centre that excuses everyone from feeling any guilt for these nuisances, exactly?

# Your play thing

There is no magical thing that happens as you cross the Symonds Street motorway overbridge from Eden Terrace into the City Centre. I presume it all rests on the crux of 'the bars were there first and you knew that when you moved there', but most nuisances are not bars - the police and liquor licensing agents do a (relatively...) decent job in that regard. We've all just collectively decided that this is how the city centre must be. 

And that is the crux. There is a perception that the "CBD" is a blank slate that exists devoid of life and you can do whatever you want *to* it, without any justification and without any consequence. This applies to personal behaviour, CCO's such as AT and WaterCare, construction consents, profit driven light and sound pollution, street space allocations (i.e. big, wide roads), Council run and approved events, and pretty much anything else. It's is a mindset deeply embedded in all layers of bureaucracy and society.

This is a perception born from the emptying out of the city and the subsequent mindset that the city is a business area by day that empties out at night to become a big party zone that exists for your pleasure and exploitation. But that is not true now, and probably never was - even 20 years ago 10,000 people lived there. Think about how many people 10,000 is. *Ten Thousand*.

It's 57,000 people now. That's a lot more than Invercargil and only a smidge less than New Plymouth, Whangarei or Rotorua.

Here is a photo of some cranes building another 155 houses in the city centre for you to look at while that sinks in.

# But we're not like...

In some other parts of the world where most people live in dense(r), urban environments, there is no such things as a "CBD" - just a collection of neighbourhoods with work and play nearby. The people out on a Friday night all live there, nearby, or in a different part of town that is equally bustling. It breeds a level of respect and understanding because you know what it is like when civility and compassion is left at the door. In Auckland, people travel from far and wide to enter a place that they appreciate and enjoy, but do not respect - expecting that place (and those who call it home, if that was ever a consideration) to tolerate whatever they decide it should, based on their own selfish needs and desires - things that they would never do and never tolerate where they live. This includes big roads that do not serve residents (Nelson, Hobson etc.)

I'm talking about Amsterdam in my example above, the city I lived in before coming back to Auckland. And don't you roll your eyes at me, because Auckland city centre is more densely populated than the Centrum (That's Dutch for "the middle bit where all the things are") borough of Amsterdam, the nearest analog to the City Centre.

Keep in mind that the Netherlands has an overall population density of 488 people/km<sup>2</sup> (17 million total) vs New Zealand's 17 people/km<sup>2</sup> (not a typo). Hopefully now you're starting to realise how extraordinary the population of the City Centre is in the context of New Zealand and how your disdain for the needs of its residents is coming from a perspective that is in need of radical adjustment (and one that is now more understandable to me at least).

# NIMBY!

These numbers don't move you at all? 

I'm not surprised. Everyone knows how the city is, so its my fault for choosing to live here, and now I'm selfish jerk for asking you all to change to accomodate me (and 57,000 other people who all also should have know better).

Any complaint along these lines is treated as NIMBY-ism, with a quizzical expression appearing on any face as they assume that I am demanding pitch black, dead silent nights and a dead city that can't function in case poor little me is disturbed. I was representing a residential perspective at a recent Auckland Transport run workshop on servicing the city centre (loading, deliveries, commercial activities). In the brainstorming session I suggested that noise associated with 24/7 operation (as was proposed) would need to factor in at least some consideration for residents. The usual line was blurted out, assuming my flat out opposition, a straw man position, rather than considering that there are likely some simple things that can be done so minimise what is completely needless noise pollution. Avoiding the need to (beep beep beep) reverse, the use of smaller and\or electric vehicles, driver training, design of access and contractor guidelines. Nothing that prevents anything, nothing unreasonable, just some simple considerations for others, instead of a selfish assumption that only business needs mattered.

Instead the issue was just ignored - I'm just a NIMBY who is selfishly aiming to prevent the city from functioning.

# You are shit

The cumulative effect is an overwhelming sense that the wider city (that is likely you, dear reader) believes city residents to be subhuman, not deserving of the same basic human needs that you believe that you are.

That these residents deserve everything that comes to them, and that you and anyone else can do anything they like and they need to suck it up, because they ~~are human excrement~~ are one of the 57,000+ people who chose to live in an apartment and walk to work, one less person competing with you at auctions, for rental properties, at the motorway on-ramp, for a seat on the bus or a table at the new cafe in your neighbourhood. 

Maybe its not for you, but next time you're sitting in traffic on Nelson or Hobson Street, why not look up at the little boxes and thank the people who live there for living there, so that you don't have to.

# You just want to whinge!

A complaint about concrete cutting starting at 10pm and going until 2am on a Sunday was responded to with details that the resource consent allows it because it would be too disruptive to business to do it any other time. My needs, and the needs of hundreds or thousands living within a few hundred meters are not relevant until we get to our workplaces tomorrow, at which point we suddenly become very important. Real people, just lIke that! A calculation was made and you are not valuable until you are generating profit.

This one is easy to fix - communicate with neighbours about the need for the work and justify it. Tell us when it will start, when it will end and and who to contact if and when breaches to their consent conditions occur. Overall, less people are disturbed if you do it in the middle of the night, I get that, but the magnitude of disturbance is not equal. The basic needs that all humans have need to be factored in. 1000 people disturbed while working with a 100db sound with a noise floor of 70db is quite different to 500 disturbed while sleeping with 100db noise with a 40db noise floor. Any time there is a compromise, it is the residents that take all the negative. That's not a compromise,that's a clear message being sent.

A road that had been completely closed for months was repainted at 11pm on a Sunday so it won't interfere with traffic. "Oh, it's very quiet", except you can hear it in your apartment on the 17th floor through double glazed windows. And it could have been done at any time of the day on any day of the week, because the road was already closed. The person approving this work may well have been you, now moving from a position of uncaring to active malice.

This one is also easy to fix. Don't assume you know how loud anything is, and think about the number of people any single nuisance will impact.

I'm not asking for the city to cease functioning, cease being a city. I'm asking for the people that visit and make decisions around the city centre to remember that residents exist and to take what are really simple steps to not ruin our lives through nothing more than carelessness, ignorance our the simple malice that I'm trying to argue against here.

# Change is impossible.

So lets look at *you* for a minute.

Are you sick of the traffic you need to sit in? Too bad, you chose to live a car dependant lifestyle in the suburbs so suck it up because we're not going to pay for your poor choices.

Ah, and you public transport sucks? Too bad, the suburbs were always like that and you knew that when you moved there.

And your rates too high? Too bad, you chose to live there and that's the cost of sprawl, so stop acting so entitled.

Is a bored teenager doing burnouts for three hours in your cul-de-sac? Too bad, you chose to live in the suburbs and that's just what bored teenagers do, so the police aren't coming.

Is a livestock truck parking on your street stinking the place up? Too bad, your neighbourhood used to be a farm and you can't just move somewhere and expect it to change to suit the needs of the current community.

What's that, your neighbour has started a business and has a large illuminated billboard on their property that lights up your bedroom all night? Tough luck - can't let NIMBYs like you get in the way of capitalism.

Oh dear, The council decided to have a concert at the park on the corner of your street where you  take your kids and you're barred from entry? Don't worry, it only runs until 2am and 10,000 people are coming. Oh, you don't like that? NIMBY. Well no one cares anyway because you decided to live in the suburbs and the council and everyone else has arbitrarily decided that that is just what its like to live there.

Did someone break into your house and is now standing over your bed screaming in your face at 4am? Too bad, you chose to live in the suburbs and I've decided that's an ok thing to do there, because *I* don't live there.

You dirty hypocrite.

# You are protected

Everything in the list above is being dealt with, luckily. For you.

We're spending truck loads of money to subsidise your long commutes. No one can find money to build a footpath on a street alongside one of the most densely populated places in the country, in my neighbourhood. We don't have a school for 57,000 people, so those most families move out when their kids get to around 7.

Public transport is being improved at great expense to bring people in from the suburbs and give them better choices for moving around. I can't get to a friends house on the other side of the city centre because the buses are designed for commuters and its quicker to walk the half an hour.

Your rates get you brand new roads and footpaths. My rates subsidise your neighbourhood - we're on the same rating system , but every apartment building with 100+ homes in it going up doesn't get a cent spent on roads, footpaths etc.

I don't know for sure if the police will come to sort out kids doing burnouts in your suburb, but they certainly aren't worried about the ones doing it for hours every weekend in mine, no matter how much we call. I presume if a gang was selling drugs outside your house on a Friday night and you called the police someone would come. They don't come when we call.

There are laws in place to protect 'residential' areas from a variety of nuisance issues issues, like a neighbour causing undue smell, or light pollution. We in the city centre are fair game for everything; as much noise, light and air pollution as *you* deem to impose on us and its enshrined in planning policy and mentality.

The council would never put on an event of such a scale in your neighbourhood without extensive planning and considerations for your safety, traffic, alcohol issues etc. The city is seen as a place to do this, and it should be - we live there because of this activity - but no amount of soundproofing can stop a big subwoofer and line of sight of loud speakers, so considerations could be made for impact mitigation on neighbours and information about when events are happening and until when. Just being good neighbours, you know? But we are ignored and treated as a nuisance, a barrier to YOU coming to our neighbourhood to have a good time at OUR expense. You are more important than we are. 

# NIMBY!!!!!!

The last crazy one about someone screaming in your face is in there to highlight that what you think the city is and should be is only part of the picture. What I think people should be subject to in St Helliers will have less weight that the residents of the area, no matter how frequently I visit. That isn't a controversial opinion, I don't think. The city has changed a lot in the last 20 years, and even more so in the passed 5. But we are still treated as guests in our own neighbourhood, secondary to visitors and businesses.

But when residents outnumber visitors, will it change? I doubt that - already we have more residents than car commuters, and that space allocation is clearly not working out in our favour just yet, is it?

# You should have known better

So how about Western Springs speedway, the ultimate NIMBY test case? Everyone knows the speedway is there, but only the people living there know how exactly how noisy it really is on race nights.

So in **scenario 1**, lets say the council now allows the speedway to have twice as many races a year - the residents oppose. Are they NIMBYs? The speedway was always there after all.

When I moved to the city centre we had the Santa parade, New Year's Eve and that was about it. It was dull, and it's better now, but over summer some residents have loud music from events and visitors causing chaos every weekend for months on end and we're told that this is how the city is. But we were there when it wasn't. It's a better place now, but it's much, much louder.

In **scenario 2** the speedway is now hosting a circus with lots of animals, and it smells like a zoo 24/7 for two weeks, and the rotting garbage only adds to it. The residents complain. Are they NIMBYs? The speedway is a commercial venture and is entitled to make money on their land and they have not exceeded the noise levels that have been agreed.

When I moved to the city centre, there was no such thing as a digital billboard, but now we are expected to put up with them as if they were always part of city life. Light pollution was something that meant your bedroom was dark but not black. Now it means an 8 second slideshow of colours and shapes dancing across your bedroom. This is a huge costs in our lives to better provide you, the visitor, with adverts. I have lived in cities where billboards are banned - they are not integral to any city.

In **scenario 3** the council rezones Old Mill road to higher density, and a row of 15, 50 unit apartments are built by Panuku, consented by the council, housing almost 1700 people where 15 used to live. The council heavily advertises the area as family friendly, close to western springs, and built to top spec, exceeding the current code (double glazing etc.) and an alternative to long commutes. The families all move in and realise that no level of soundproofing can stop the noise, babies are kept awake, kids are too tired to do well at school, families are grumpy and fight. Sure, you say, they should have known better, but how responsible is the council?

That brings us to....

# The unfulfilled promise

The city centre master plan, published in 2012, sets out objectives around the resident population (amongst many other things). This document lays out what the council aspires for the city to be.

> **OUTCOME 3**
> 
> A city centre that meets the needs of a growing and changing residential population.
> 
> **Target 1**: Number and size of play spaces increases
> 
> **Target 2**: Increase in number of children living in city centre
> 
> **Target 3**: Increase in residents’ perceptions of a sense of safety in the city centre after dark
> 
> **Indicator 4**: Decrease in crime rates in city centre
> 
> **Target 5**: Increase in the proportion of residents who rate a sense of community in the city centre as being important
> 
> **Target 6**: Increase in the proportion of residents who feel a sense of community in the city centre

We want more children, but when will they sleep? There are no new parks planned.

We want a safer city centre with lower crime, so why do we treat it as a free-for all with policing levels that cannot keep up with the rate of major crimes being committed, let alone the constant background level of 'nuisance' crimes that negatively impact residents?

> **FACTOR 3: INCLUSIVENESS AND A CHILD-FRIENDLY CITY**
> 
> ...
> 
> These include high-quality and affordable housing for families;  providing for alcohol use and adult entertainment while maintaining the city as a safe place for children;  and balancing competing uses for open space,  **while considering noise levels and the requirements of urban neighbourhoods.**
> 
> ...
> 
> In a 2008 survey carried out by the Auckland University of Technology (AUT), University Local Government Centre (on behalf of the Children’s Commissioner) and Auckland City Council, children said they experienced their homes as warm and safe, but identified the following issues with   living in the city:
> 
> ...
> 
> Noise from people, traffic, construction, music and ships
> 
> ...

But we have a solution!

> THE MASTERPLAN ENVISAGES:
> 
> ...
> 
>  - Noise management measures
> 
> ...

Except the same council does not believe that we deserve anything of the sort.

So we have a set of expectations that have been delivered to us. We are not making this up.

# I'm still not convinced.

Well I tried.

Just know, I love the city centre, far more than you do. I don't want to ruin what is good about it. I just want to sleep.
