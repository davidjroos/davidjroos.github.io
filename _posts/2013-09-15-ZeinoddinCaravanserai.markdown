The Caravanserai was amazing and I was the only person there.

Drank copious amounts of water and ate some dinner before going up onto
the roof to watch the stars for an hour. It was a half full moon, but
still lovely. Saw two satellites. It was windy, in a nice way.

I picked an ‘outside’ room as the inside rooms were just two curtains. I
initially regretted this decision as it was rather warm that night, but
it cooled down fairly quickly and I slept as well as could be expected
on the rather firm mattresses.

Up early (5:30) for sunrise – started by watching the stars fade, as the
sun (every so slowly) crept up. Walked around a bit and found some deer
spoor (amongst others…). There are cheetahs around here too. Spent most
of my time up on the roof.
