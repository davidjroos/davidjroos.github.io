Drove over a chicken driving up the valley to the start of the walk up.
Beautiful area. Garbage, people just... sitting amongst it.

The climb took an hour, but I was feeling sprightly and it was
beautiful. The castle is amazing, the position is breathtaking from the
southwest end and I just sat up there for about 15 minutes enjoying
being away from the rabble down below.

40 minutes back down the hill and on the road to Tehran again.

Traffic heading back in was pretty bad and we got stuck about an hour
out, so stopped for burgers at Apache which were excellent. Got to the
hotel at about 22:30 - the same room as when I first arrived.
