No intersection within the entire Victoria Quarter has been designed or
retrofitted to create comfortable, safe crossing for pedestrians. The
map below highlights the areas that will make up the bulk of the
discussion in this section.

The Intersections are numbered for discussion. I'll show a historical
map for each, some example photos and some historical photos to show
(mostly) that these streets were massive long before cars came along.

## 1\\\. Drake and Union Street

Union Street is inappropriately wide for the marked 50kph limit and used
primarily for cars to cut through to Cook Street or higher up Union
Street. There is no safe crossing where it meets with Drake Street.

The raised table granting access to Victoria Park is a positive, but
difficult to access from most approaches. The median strip could
feasibly be intended to serve as a pedestrian refuge.

Six car widths for a quiet, local street, minutes from the central city
and an unnecessary barrier to pedestrians.

It is unlikely that the majority of these drivers are heading to local
businesses - the visible tyre marks indicate a trend to the right,
heading up to Cook Street. There is a motorway off-ramp located nearby
that achieves exactly this and a selection of wide, high volume roads
available to get uptown from Victoria Street.

A ‘safe’ and inconvenient crossing is provided further up on Union
Street. The image below is the view from the middle of the ‘crossing’
for context on how wide the street is, keeping in mind that cars will be
in the process of ‘picking’ lanes here as they accelerate up the hill.

Though there are tactile pavers, they are unfortunately only on the
North-Eastern end of the crossing – on the South-Western side you are
required to enter the footpath via a driveway. Visibility down the
street is also impacted by poor tree placement – for people with a
bicycle, pram or wheelchair it is impossible to see approaching traffic
without getting dangerously close to the road edge. I have raised a
request with the council to trim or remove the tree, but no action has
been taken.

## 2\. Drake/Vernon/Wellesley

It is difficult to describe exactly why this intersection is so poor,
due to the very strange nature of it. What is clear is that it has the
goal of accommodating as many car movement options as possible, without
any consideration for pedestrians. Cars approach from multiple
directions, with sweeping corners allowing high speed manoeuvres in
every direction. Visibility is reduced due to parked cars on all
approaches. It’s unclear why a turn from Wellesley is provided, as there
is a generous entrance on Sale Street only 150 meters up the hill. The
double left turn slip lane onto Victoria is the only ‘safe’ crossing
nearby.

The main ‘gateway’ into Victoria Quarter is the opening of Sale Street
onto Wellesley Street. Immediately on the intersection are Brew Bar, the
City Works Depot, Les Mills and Glengarry. Multiple new office blocks
and hundreds of existing and currently under construction residential
units are within a few hundred meters.

A large volume of users in multiple modes make use of this intersection
every day, but it is completely inappropriate for pedestrians – even if
it were to be presumed that midblock crossings should be prevented,
crossing the face of Sale Street is treacherous, with the wide radius of
the corner allowing even trucks to corner at high speeds:

<div class="google-maps">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2H7Tn1JS6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>
</div>

The expected increase in buses (see Part 1) and traffic pressures from
the NZICC will only make this worse, all while an increase in
residential and commercial population is occurring.

The issues preventing crossing need to be addressed to allow pedestrian
movements in all directions to reconnect this area with the rest of
Victoria Quarter and the rest of the city. Ignoring these needs presents
a serious failure in regards to the safety of all users and the
prioritisation of vehicle movements must be weighed against the needs
and safety of local users.

The already wide intersection is widened further by another, smaller
road alongside it, used exclusively for parking, immediately adjacent to
the large Tournament Carpark.

## 4\. Sale/Cook Street

What was a simple intersection and what should now be a quiet, (vehicle)
dead-end is once again impacted by a wide, sweeping, left turn, blind
rise and no safe pedestrian crossing.

This photo presents an extreme case that will hopefully be short lived,
but it is reality as of today and visibility is not much better without
the truck due to the blind rise and generally high speed of cars.

## Who's fault is this?

I don't care.

## Wrapping up

-   Victoria Quarter is singled out in the Auckland District Plan, the
    Auckland Plan and the City Centre Master Plan as a place destined to
    be a ‘vibrant urban community’, ‘for families seeking an inner-city
    lifestyle’, but requiring “Significant investment in amenity of the
    area and its streets’
-   The current design of the area is neither vibrant nor urban and the
    road designs bordering the area preclude any connectivity with the
    remainder of Victoria Quarter or the wider city
-   There is no stated or existing plan to perform the needed investment
    in the amenity of the area
-   A large number of new residential and commercial buildings are
    already underway
-   This area is and will be very well supported by Transit, including
    the Northern Express and trains upon completion of the City Rail
    Link, but the entire focus at present is on car access and parking

### Desired Outcomes

There are four major issues that need to be addressed to achieve the
stated goals:

-   The Cook Street motorway off-ramp severs connectivity to the South,
    with any changes hung up in NZTA route protection for the AWHC,
    currently slated for decade 3 by ATAP
-   A history of choices, actions and inactions have resulted in
    Victoria Quarter being a glorified parking lot, with a high priority
    placed on car parking and car movements at speed, against all stated
    goals for the area and good access to transit
-   Major intersections in and out of the area favour vehicles and
    provide a dangerous barrier to pedestrians, especially children, the
    elderly and infirm. Expected increases to the number of buses on
    Wellesley Street across Sale Street will further enforce
    this barrier.
-   Existing pedestrian amenities fall well short all NZTA and ATCOP
    standards and the area does not meet even basic access needs to
    those in wheelchairs or experiencing other impairments

Short Term:

-   Identify or assign a hierarchy of needs/uses for the area
-   Address poor intersection design with kerb buildouts, tactical
    urbanism
-   Create a traffic plan to limit the area to local traffic only, as
    far as is reasonable
-   Provide a temporary solution to address the severance of Cook Street
-   Produce a safe, midblock crossing
-   Introduce speed reduction tools to slow Cook Street off-ramp traffic
-   Grade separate Cook Street off-ramp traffic from local traffic
-   Reduce parking and reinstate adequate, compliant footpaths to
    improve pedestrian amenity
-   Implement 30pkh speed limit throughout the area

Medium-Long Term:

-   Develop plan to fully implement hierarchy of needs/use for the area
-   Creation of a tangible desired state for the area, in the context of
    the user hierarchy
-   Use the City Centre Masterplan definitions to create tangible goals
-   Perform a gap analysis and development of a plan to address issues
    with current best practise, or better
-   Improved connections to Freemans bay

### Anything else?

As long as this was, consider the things I haven't covered at all:

-   How utterly awful the City Works Depot is
-   Nelson Street, Victoria Street or Southern Union Street
-   Public spaces and Trees, greenery
-   Cycling and bicycle parking (or lack thereof)
-   The loss of entire streets
-   The loss of street facing 'fine grained' building styles
-   The loss of inner city housing stock that may well be extremely
    valuable today (look at those little picket fences!)
-   There used to be a school (schools?) here
