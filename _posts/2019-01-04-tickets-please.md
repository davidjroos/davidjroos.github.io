## Western Victoria Quarter Part 5a: Some Progress

Part 5a doesn't officially exist, but I got a bike lane between Victoria Park and Nelson Street as well as a signalised crossing on Cook Street, near Morton. Union Street will be much better. Yay.

Well, in about 6 more months.

A tactical intersection change was proposed for Sale/Wellesley, but AT stole it from the ADO and it's gone silent for months. Must chase that up....

Anyway, onto todays story, AKA:

## Western Victoria Quarter Part 5b: The Ticketing

You may notice above that nothing is happening at the Drake\Vernon intersection. This will likely (hopefully) get resolved (well, hopefully) when the Wellesley Street bis upgrade happens.

You may also notice that nothing at all has happened to address any of the footpath issues raised. This has endlessly frustrated me, and I've been meaning to (politely) bombard AT with tickets to get official responses on each issue. Either progress is made, or I have a clear "AT refuses to follow ATs own standards for footpaths" to take to the Local Board, Planning Comittee, ACCAB etc.

So today I did that. I will revisit this post with ticket numbers and response timeframes

All tickets raised (Friday) 4 January 2019 and are reproduced verbatim below (with attached images)

## 1: Missing Pram Ramps at Vernon Street/Sale Street Intersection

The footpath to road transition does not have a ramp in line with ATCOP, meaning wheelchair users, prams and others with physical disabilities struggle to cross this intersection.

As the area becomes filled with more residents and businesses, these basic walking compliance fixes must be given priority to ensure that the homes and businesses here are accessible to all Aucklanders.

## 2: Missing Pram Ramps at Centre Street/Sale Street Intersection

The footpath to road transition does not have a ramp in line with ATCOP, meaning wheelchair users, prams and others with physical disabilities struggle to cross this intersection.

As the area becomes filled with more residents and businesses, these basic walking compliance fixes must be given priority to ensure that the homes and businesses here are accessible to all Aucklanders.

<p class='wideimage'><img src='https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-01_800.jpg' srcset='https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-01_2000.jpg 2000w, https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-01_1200.jpg 1200w, https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-01_800.jpg 800w' sizes='100vw' width='2000'/></p>

<p class='wideimage'><img src='https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-02_800.jpg' srcset='https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-02_2000.jpg 2000w, https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-02_1200.jpg 1200w, https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/davidroos.co.nz/photos/20190104ticketsplease/02-02_800.jpg 800w' sizes='100vw' width='2000'/></p>

## 3: Missing Pram Ramp at Sale Street Entrance to City Works Depot

The entrance to the City Works depot parking lot from from Sale Street is dangerous for pedestrians in its current configuration and impossible to cross  - the footpath to road transition does not have a ramp in line with ATCOP, meaning wheelchair users, prams and others with physical disabilities struggle to cross this intersection. This is shown in the attached photo - the only possible route is around (into the road...), and then entering the footpath again through a driveway. This is not acceptable when we are spending millions elsewhere in the city on pedestrian priority, but cannot find any interest in the more basic needs of people.

Additionally, while it is a driveway to private land from the road, it is designed to appear as a road (or has never been brought up to compliance to current standards since its inception as the original City Works site). Being a driveway, pedestrians have right of way across the face, but the design, combined with the high volume of traffic into and out of the parking lot, creates a dangerous situation:

Vehicles treat it as a road and do not give way to pedestrians. If a pedestrian attempts to assert their rights, they are likely to be hit and injured or killed, due to the high speed of vehicles on Sale Street (due to its extreme wideness). 

As the area becomes filled with more residents and businesses, these basic walking compliance fixes must be given priority to ensure that the homes and businesses here are accessible to all Aucklanders.

Both issues will be rectified if the footpath is reinstated appropriately and that is the request of this ticket.

## 4: Missing Footpath on Adelaide Street

There is no footpath for a long section of Adelaide Street. The opposite side if the street features a footpath with camber, furniture and regular blocking (from vehicles and wheelie bins) resulting in a space too narrow to walk along for a fit adult, and impossible to navigate with in a wheelchair, with a pram or with even minor physical disabilities.

The result is people walking in the street instead, which can be witnessed at any time.

As the area becomes filled with more residents and businesses, these basic walking compliance fixes must be given priority to ensure that the homes and businesses here are accessible to all Aucklanders.

I am requesting that ATCOP compliant footpaths be provided on both sides of the street.

## 5\6\7: Vernon\Centre\Adelaide Street - Footpath widths, gradients, crossfalls and visibility around driveways

[street name] Street does provide sufficient, safe access for all users. Improper Footpath widths, gradients, crossfalls and visibility around driveways create an environment that is challenging for a fit adult, and impossible to navigate in a wheelchair, with a pram or with even minor physical disabilities.

The specific defects are clear when the street is compared with the (minimum) standards set out in ATCOP and NZTAPPG, and are highlighted below. 

Some samples of the issues are provided in the attached images.

> ### Footpath Widths (NZTAPPG 14.2.2, ATCOP 12.4)

> Passing Places (NZTAPPG 14.2.3)
"Where footpaths have not been provided to a suitable standard in the past, RCAs should develop works programmes to bring them up to a suitable standard."

> "Where through route width is constrained to less than 1.5 metres wide, passing places should be provided"

> ### Gradient & Crossfall (NZTAPPG 14.4, ATCOP 12.5, 12.6)
"Some crossfall is required for drainage, but excessive crossfall in the through route requires people using wheelchairs and walking frames to use extra energy to resist the sideways forces. As the crossfall is invariably towards the road where footpaths are in the road reserve, anyone losing their balance is directed towards motorised traffic"

> ### Driveways (NZTAPPG 14.11)

> "Driveways should have a level landing at the top, and be at least 1.2 m wide across the through path. The crossfall should be less than two percent, with the gradient differing from the adjacent through path by less than two percent."

I seek for this street to become compliant with at least the minimum standards set out in ATCOP - as the area becomes filled with more residents and businesses, these basic walking compliance fixes must be given priority to ensure that the homes and businesses here are accessible to all Aucklanders. Safe pedestrian facilities must be provided for Auckland Transport to stake any claim towards achieving Vision Zero.

## 8: Cook Street footpath renewal

The footpaths on Cook Street (Between Morton and Sale) are in dire need of maintenance. A new pedestrian crossing is being installed at Sam Wrigley/Morton Street and an improved pedestrian connection to Victoria Park provided along Union Street - this will improve connectivity in the area, but leads people to some very rough and poorly maintained footpaths.
