### Tuesday 1 February 2011

4:25 wake up and we were on our way before 5. 45km we were at Dune 45
which we started to climb in the dark. Climbing giant sand dunes is
really hard work, especially when you end up at the front and there are
no pre compressed steps to walk in.

We and the dutch guys (who happened to be there at the same time) were
the only ones to make it to the top but it was worth it.

After a cup of very strong coffee we were on our way again to
Sossussvlei and a short walk to Deadvlei.

Back at the vehicle we had a quick drive around the vlei before heading
out....

...to find that the water had once again arrived at Sossussvlei. This
only happens every 4 or 5 years so we were quite lucky to witness it
pouring in (and that we didn't come down in the Combi because we would
have been stuck!)

We found a mechanic who came to our site and started the car first try
and it drove fine. Annoying. Still don't know what happened, possibly
heat or something else â€“ it was a rough day for the poor old combi, but
it pulled through.

We lazed about the rest of the day, swimming, eating and sleeping before
(successfully) heading to Sesreim for sunset
