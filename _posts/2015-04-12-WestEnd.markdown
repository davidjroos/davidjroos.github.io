The West End is great. I'm always relieved to return.

Northeast across West Georgia is Coal Harbour, East across Burrard is
the Business District, South Across Burrard is Yaletown. To the North is
Stanley Park with English Bay to the East.

</div>


I see it as having eight 'regions':

-   **North East of Robson** - Includes the high-end Alberni shopping
    precinct at the South end and not much else
-   **Robson Street** - the main retail street down town - clothing,
    cosmetics, Tesla, supermarkets, dining etc.
-   **Denman Street** - the west end of it intersects with the beach at
    English Bay, so ice cream, food, food, food. All the food, from end
    to end
-   **Davie Street** - The fabulous part of town - a 'daily' street -
    groceries, food, misc shopping
-   **The 'middle bit'** - everything inside Robson, Denman and Davie.
    This is where most people live - lots of apartment towers of varying
    ages and qulity, quiet tree-lined streets and the occasional villa
-   **The 'steep bit'** - between Davie and Beach\\Pacific Boulevard at
    the south west - generally nicer places with ocean views
-   **The 'best bit'** - between Denman and Stanley Park - flat, close
    to beaches, the park, buses. Nicer apartments with views.
-   **The Seawall** - Sunset Beach and English Bay

So why is it great? I'll cover four things that contribute:

-   Density and Variety
-   Pedestrian Right of way
-   Traffic Calming
-   Cycling Infrastructure

Density and Variety {#densityandvariety}
-------------------

There are a wide range of housing types - standalone houses\\villas,
conversions, terraced houses, low-rise apartments and high rise
apartments. The vast majority live in the latter, with a population
density of \~22,000 people per square kilometer and a total size of only
2 square kilometers (for a total of \~45,000 people). There are more
children living here than the traditionally family oriented suburbs in
Vancouver and there are two primary schools and one high school.

Aesthetic quality of apartments vary, but many buildings are 50+ years
old, and in many cases have removed 'dated' brickword and balcanies and
replaced with clean lines and glass. I love the brutalism, the 60s
brickwork, the weird and wonderful. Some are timeless, some are ...not.

This density of people is not apparent at street level - it's tree lined
and quiet, but it enables a wide variety of activity, employment and
eateries within walking and cycling distance - most people do not own
cars. My building's car park is half empty but the bike room is full.

Pedestrian Right of way {#pedestrianrightofway}
-----------------------

There are two critical factors that make it great to be a pedestrian
(beyond the traffic calming measures discussed shortly):

-   Pedestrians have right of way, by law
-   Sheer numbers

The first point is a game-changer. I have the right to stare down cars
as I step out on front of them and know that they have to stop. And they
do. Especially in the West End where the vast, vast majority of people
either do not own a car or very rarely drive - it's expected that there
are people everywhere and cars drive accordingly (for the most part).
Magically, every street is a shared street, without spending millions on
redesigning the road to make it look less like a road.

The usual types of people (in certain types of cars) often attempt to
rat run through the quiet streets and they stand out because they are
aggressive and dangerous. It's, unfortunately, even more dangerous,
considering the expectations all users have of the area. These 'worst'
motorists are your everyday New Zealand drivers and are comprised of
people who do not live in the West End - people who view the area as an
obstacle to getting where they want to be as quickly as possible.

Traffic Calming {#trafficcalming}
---------------

As best I can see, everything great about the 'middle' and 'good' bits
comes back to traffic calming measures. Cars are not banned from any
streets, but they are dissuaded from using quiet residential streets
unless they actually have need to. As a result, these inner streets are
quiet and civil. These measures also create calm, communal places, as I
will document.

Below is a map, it shows main\\busy roads in red (Robson, Denman, Davie,
Thurlow and Burrard) and 'through' roads in orange (just Nelson) , with
traffic several calming measures numbered for discussion below. It's not
a complete listing, but these physical layouts, combined with strategic
one-wayedness, results in no direct routes through the West End outside
of the red and orange lines.

### 1. Haro\\Bute {#1harobute}

This block of pedestrian space interrupts Bute - here we are only one
block from the busy Robson Street, but as it's impossible to drive
through, the road leading to/from here is musch quieter than would
otherwise be expected.

As in all the cases I'll show here, there are planters, a community
noticeboard, trash bins, seating and lighting.

Residential access and presence

From the south end, signs communicate the futility of entering.

### 2. Nelson\\Broughton {#2nelsonbroughton}

A few block away we have a similar arrangement - a block closed off to
cars, and humanised.

Community noticeboard, beautiful flowers and newspaper boxes. Still
considered a 4 way stop in consideration of people on bikes.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8798/17126001035_6d51a99313_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8798/17126001035_577f44f9f5_o.jpg)

Seating, lighting, plants. Amongst them is an apartment entrance.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8803/16918608497_75d80e9f26_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8803/16918608497_6fd93529e5_o.jpg)

Residential and commercial interaction

### 3. Pendrell\\Nicola {#3pendrellnicola}

Same story here.

Looking South from the street

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7697/17125998635_9cac472ed0_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7697/17125998635_cb65d412f7_o.jpg)

Residential access

### 4. Comox\\Cardero {#4comoxcardero}

Here we have a similar story, with a different scale.

To the left is the Primary School

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8812/17125360761_dc0beff486_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8812/17125360761_8455996b02_o.jpg)

A corner store

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8702/16503556344_54b9bec3f1_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8702/16503556344_48fa66141f_o.jpg)

Seating, looking North towards Comox cycle street

Looking South at the street

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7658/17124442132_1f51813723_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7658/17124442132_fd2b7accc1_o.jpg)

The School and seating

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7727/16939807659_7cb1b78b40_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7727/16939807659_5f2a935ec6_o.jpg)

### 5. Pendrell\\Bidwell {#5pendrellbidwell}

Something a bit different - instead of changing a block, what would be a
4 way intersection is limited to right angle turns only, directing cars
back to the main street while allowing pedestrians and cyclists through.
They also provide some colour.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8820/16503553314_1f70990d1a_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8820/16503553314_f040fa9c79_o.jpg)
[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8819/16939787539_5473f79b8a_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8819/16939787539_9492eb8eac_o.jpg)

### 6. Barclay\\Bidwell {#6barclaybidwell}

The High School at the end of the street creates an obstacle to cars,
but allows pedestrians through.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8745/16938452130_348e523046_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8745/16938452130_a72119d748_o.jpg)

(This is mostly here because I wanted a picture of my favourite house in
here somehow.)

### 7. Haro\\Cardero {#7harocardero}

Again, a 4 way intersection is limited to two right angle turns.

Directly ahead here is Robson Street, but this intersection manages to
be very quiet.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7601/17100046966_de67e593d2_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7601/17100046966_5b4fa3dfae_o.jpg)

Flowers everywhere. I think there is too much on street parking allowed,
but it's not the end of the world.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8822/16503533874_791c8f8f33_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8822/16503533874_900a66d86f_o.jpg)

### 8. Haro\\Gildford {#8harogildford}

On the other side of Denman we have two blocks next to each other set as
car free.

On the North Side. I'm not a fan of the gate - I've seen a couple around
and they seem very unnecessary.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7691/17124438812_de32349ddc_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7691/17124438812_5845d811ce_o.jpg)
[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7600/16505839423_d908606e8d_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7600/16505839423_f8078fa5da_o.jpg)
[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7588/17125989605_9e47bdd327_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7588/17125989605_4b32ca0750_o.jpg)

And the South

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7653/17125353511_765b152a7e_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7653/17125353511_bd251fb1d4_o.jpg)\

I stopped to allow a man walking along here to pass without being in my
photos, but he informed me that he was only here to 'catch up on the
news'.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7654/16503548864_9c82c5bf61_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7654/16503548864_f53c16838c_o.jpg)

On the left are apartment entrances, on the right a cafe.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7716/17125987855_2d5f38e201_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7716/17125987855_3b9b36a722_o.jpg)

### 9. Haro\\Lagoon Drive {#9harolagoondrive}

At the very end of Haro, cars are prevented from connecting through to
Lagoon Drive. On a busy day, a lot of cars would be coming up through
here and onto quiet back streets. This disconnect ensures cars end up on
Robson instead. Pedestrians and cyclists are unimpeded going to and
coming from the park.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7615/16938446980_9c147bb36f_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7615/16938446980_731f6ea25a_o.jpg)

### 10. Comox\\Chilco {#10comoxchilco}

Block closed off to traffic

A lane-way runs across the face, with parking up to the edge.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7709/16503546964_ac3253357a_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7709/16503546964_8a9ee88aa8_o.jpg)

Apartment entrances, quiet sitting space.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8760/17125350431_e4e37af5d3_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8760/17125350431_c75fcb81e0_o.jpg)

Gardens

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8703/16938198658_a85bd0c25e_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8703/16938198658_1530478cd7_o.jpg)

### 11. Comox\\Stanley Park {#11comoxstanleypark}

At the end of Comox street is a dead end, for cars. Through the trees
are tennis courts, a car park, a nine hold golf course and the entirety
of Stanley Park.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8819/16503544924_5d404f1151_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8819/16503544924_3ae1dceab9_o.jpg)

Properties tend to maintain nice frontages.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8797/17124432512_81cce9295f_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8797/17124432512_6234b96358_o.jpg)

High demand.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7604/16939797089_8a699ee89c_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7604/16939797089_8940c6799a_o.jpg)

### 12. Pendrell\\Gildford {#12pendrellgildford}

Another simple 4 way intersection blocker. Straight ahead is English Bay
and the seawall. This road layout ensures cars do not cut in rather than
going through the large, busy intersection at Denman

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7671/17125347751_a8428d9d32_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7671/17125347751_4814e2cab3_o.jpg)

### 13. Pendrell\\Bute {#13pendrellbute}

Our last example - this intersection prevents driving between the busy
Nelson and Davie streets

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8760/17124430802_ac909150ab_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8760/17124430802_c6a9fcbfec_o.jpg)

Cycling Infrastructure {#cyclinginfrastructure}
----------------------

The real cycling infrastructure here comes from the(by design) quiet
nature of these streets. Beyond that, it's mostly 'sharrows' and shared
spaces. There is one 'real' cycleway - Comox Street, from Stanley Park
to Burrard Street.

We start at the tennis courts in Stanley Park, looking South East

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8695/16939795039_9ec722bcb1_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8695/16939795039_a44f63e9da_o.jpg)

Nothing but speed signage here, but there is nowhere to drive to/from,
so traffic is non-existent.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7726/16918583987_8b489e7881_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7726/16918583987_3b4525bb1c_o.jpg)

At the Chilco intersection (described earlier). We'll keep going
straight - sharrows as far as you can see. It does get a little bit busy
through these blocks.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7663/16918590017_04152b8b0e_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7663/16918590017_d0a636d5bd_o.jpg)

At the intersection with Denman. Cars can only turn right, which limits
the usefulness and thus traffic of this road. Sharrows lead you into the
bike bay.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7649/16503540624_1616f9d3fc_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7649/16503540624_a97c0b166a_o.jpg)

After crossing the intersection and looking back - again, one way for
cars and they can only turn right.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7593/16938439720_59b5017162_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7593/16938439720_1a6c2f5f19_o.jpg)

A bit further up, looking back towards Denman. There are breaks in the
separation to allow exiting the bike lanes to get into apartments. It
look like small bays were cut into the kerb to allow some car parking -
there are no bays like this anywhere else in the West End that I'm aware
of.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7660/16503539444_91946ce0d8_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7660/16503539444_58ee9e18ef_o.jpg)

Our separated lane ends, as does the one way nature of the street.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7635/17125978935_561a5be4cb_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7635/17125978935_564ff22dcc_o.jpg)

The intersection with Cardero. To the right is the pedestrianised block
and the Primary School.

[![](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8744/16918587437_9a8b71314e_c.jpg)](http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8744/16918587437_10afdd1dfa_o.jpg)

The road becomes one way again, in the opposite direction. Sharrows
going up the hill, a painted line going down the hill.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7624/17125342811_1df3985efc_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7624/17125342811_7a9b9d1171_o.jpg)

The next block is Nicola. The one way car lane reverses again, as does
the bike markings (sharrows going down the hill, painted line going up
the hill)

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7613/16505827243_539f463a28_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7613/16505827243_b99540193f_o.jpg)\

Looking back down from the next block.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7725/16503536754_85995e28d2_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7725/16503536754_6eee440075_o.jpg)

And up - no more paint

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7664/16503536274_2c5ff7eb04_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7664/16503536274_0e0477c34f_o.jpg)

Then we reach Bute, where we carry on down towards Thurlow, then Burrard
- you can pick it up a few steps into 'Plan C'
