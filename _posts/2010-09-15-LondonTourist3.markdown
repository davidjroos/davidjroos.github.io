### Monday 13 September 2010

Monday morning I arrived back in London from Lyon. Technically Sunday
night, but didnt actually get home and to bed till 2am. I slept in late
and took the day off to try and recover (keeping in mind that I am still
horribly jet-lagged.

### Tuesday 14 September 2010

Battersea &lt;3. For obvious reasons.

After that was The Millennium Bridge which was pretty cool and St Paul's
cathedral and Patternoster square for lunch. Back across the bridge I
went to the Tate Modern gallery which contained generally large piles of
excrement. We're all entitled opinions are we not? Next stop Tower
bridge… or… well, I can see it from here.. I'll just go home and sleep
some more.

### Wednesday 15 September 2010

Buckingham Palace. Full of people. I don't see the attraction - there
are much better sights in London that boring old Buckingham Palace. I
feel that it's only famous now because it's famous, or at least that is
why people go there. It's the Paris Hilton of London attractions. Do you
really think you're going to see the Queen? Really?

Anyway. Westminster Abbey is a beautiful building, but like St Paul's
expect me to pay to see the inside of it. For what reason I do not know,
and for better or worse I will never know how they look inside. I'm not
cheap, I'd just rather have the (at least) three meals that entry to
each would have cost me.

Westminster Palace was lovely looking, and I enjoyed the security guards
with MP5 semi automatic rifles. Not sure if that was normal levels of
security or if it was Pope related.

Finally, back to Trafalgar square and the National Gallery. There was a
weird robot in the square, no idea what it was there to do.

[![](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7653/16845142990_64f3b24f75_c.jpg)](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7653/16845142990_c94a0f2da9_o.jpg)

The gallery was good, not interested in the mostly dull portraits or the
excessive amount of religious iconography, but there were some beautiful
landscapes and I managed to find the lady in the red dress that I
remembered seeing when I was there in 2000. I get the feeling art and
history are not really my interests, as hard as I try to pretend that I
am civilised.

### Thursday 16 September 2010

Sat on my arse all day, taking it easy, packing and writing this!

Where to from here? Finish packing tonight, then eggs and bacon on
English Muffins.

I have a 9:55am flight from Heathrow tomorrow morning to LAX. There I
have about 9 hours to kill. I'm still undecided what to do, but if I can
find a power point I will spend most of the day watching movies/tv shows
on my laptop or reading my long book. If I am able to check my luggage
in early I will take a half hour walk to in-n-out burger just near the
airport for lunch, and then im guessing McDonalds or whatever else is
cheap in Terminal 1 for dinner once I've checked in and waiting. Then it
is on to Charlotte North Carolina where I have just enough time to
change flights and then finally to San Jose. I don't know how many hours
it will take and I don't want to. I will have two days at my Hostel in
San Jose before I meet up with Raleigh, one of which will be spent
sleeping and the other exploring a bit. A bit over seeing cities to be
honest. Anyway, we head to Field Base at Turribala early on the 21st.
After that I have no idea, but I will get in touch as soon as is
possible - I'm sure I can sneak 2 minutes on the internet.

I will be online at the Hostel in San Jose on the late afternoon of
their 18th, which I guess makes it morning-lunch in NZ (They are GMT -6
hours), putting them 6 hours ahead on the previous day, aka 18 hours
behind).

Until then!
